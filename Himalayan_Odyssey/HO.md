Dreams to Memories – Wisdom in Ladakh.To read this click [here](language.md).
A ride to ladakh requires a lot of preparation and begins with convincing folks back home and also at the office. As a popular quote says “Four Wheels move the body and two wheels move the soul” just riding 2500 Kms in 15 days was not the only objective of the dream I had for some time now. 
It was also to ensure that there is enough learning from the ride to be taken back home and be a better human being apart from being a better rider. The ride on a RE to ladakh was in preparation for almost 3 years and as Kabir said “Slowly slowly O mind... 
Everything in own pace happens, Gardner may water a hundred buckets...
Fruit arrives only in its season”, and happen to participate this July on the ride with ~70 other riders.
The ride included a lot of scenic beauty, the challenge of riding on various kinds of surface gravels, slush, watercrossing, sand and tarmac included, mental and physical challenge. One of the first ritual of the day was briefing which included the route, regroup point, road situation, mistakes committed by other riders and challenges. One thing every rider was keen to listen during briefing was Riding Tips.
These were not just the tips for the ride of the day but for the entire journey and was expected to be taken back home and apply when you ride anytime and anywhere. 
Every person’s life is a journey and we come across various challenges and paths which we have to cross and move ahead. 
The tips do have hidden meaning which I happen to think during the ride as to how this can benefit our daily life
• Look ahead of person you are following.
This tip was the first on day one. 
It is common in riding that you follow a person at a comfortable speed to reduce the stress and only when you need to speed up you plan to overtake. 
In this process what is missed out is the visibility beyond the lead. The visibility beyond the lead ignites the thought process as to the reason for the driving behavior of the person who is being followed.
This also helps in anticipating any obstacles and challenges well in advance and be prepared. This changes from reactive mode of riding to the anticipative mode of riding.
For career growth you need to apply the same principle of looking beyond your manager in anticipating the challenges. 
Do not end your thought process where the manager begins, try and walk the path alongside to know the challenges handled by the manager and the approach taken to resolve. 
As a parent the tendency is to not provide the visibility to our children on the challenges the parent is undergoing. 
Parents try to carry the kids on their shoulders to avoid a treacherous path. 
This in no way helps the younger generation to be prepared for the path when they are required to over take or take a new path which the parent does not even has thought off.
