You equip your trusty iron pickaxe and start digging downwards.

You are immediately surrounded by dirt and can't see a thing, but you keep digging.

After a while you dig through what appears to be the ceiling of a huge natural cave,

Since you were digging downwards you fell straight to the floor!

The cave wasn't so tall and you get up without a scratch.

The cave is covered in darkness...

You decide to light up your lighter.

Ahead of you lie two diverging tunnels one to the left and the other one to your right.

Behind you a single path into darkness.
