An wrinkly old man with a funny hat appears from nowhere.  He approaches you, removes his hat and removes a red pill from within it which he hands to you with a glass of chocolate milk. Reluctantly, you take the pill and place it on your tounge then drink the milk.

Within seconds, you feel dizzy and disorriented, but also euphoric.   You become hungry but only for tacos as the man who gave you the pills turns into a crow an flies away.
