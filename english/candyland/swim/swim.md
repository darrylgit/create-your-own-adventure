You walk over and try to stand in the melted marshmallow.

You realize that it doesn't feel like marshmallow at all. 

It is not sticky and in fact is quite milky smooth. 

You lean forward and lick the frothy concoction.

Your mouth is filled with a sweet sugary creamy sweet delight.

You start to realize the milk is getting very cold and deep.

What is remaining of the room has filled up to chest high and is the consistency of a milk shake.

Your begin to move your arms and legs to stay aloat and being to tread milkshare.

You see a picture on the wall of a Queen standing by a sign.

It says: "The Ice Cream Sea"
