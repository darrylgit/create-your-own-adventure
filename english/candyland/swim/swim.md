You walk over and try to stand in the melted marshmallow.

You realize that it doesn't feel like marshmallow at all. 

It is not overly sticky and is milky smooth. 

You lick the frothy concoction and your mouth is filled with a sweet sugary cream sweetness.

Why you are standing in ice cream and it's starting to get quite deep.

The room has filled up to the point it is about chest high now.

Your going to have to start swimming. 

You see a picture on the wall of a Queen standing by a sign.

It says: "The Ice Cream Sea"
