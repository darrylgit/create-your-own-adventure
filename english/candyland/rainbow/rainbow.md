As you look, you realize the colored lights from the GumDrop mountain are
coming closer. 

They swoop down in magnificent rainbow style and land directly at your feet.

Reaching out and touching the rainbow its not actually light at all. It's more candy!

Wondering what it taste the rainbow your desire overcomes your rational concerns about diabetes.

You lean forward, close your eyes, and lick across all the colors of the rainbow. 

Instead of the usual flavors they taste gross.

You can identify a few of the odd flavors. 

Yellow taste like barf, and green taste like boogers.

You remember your chidhood and feel ashamed you know what those taste like. 

You begin to cry uncontrollably.
