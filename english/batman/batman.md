But I know what you're wondering. If Bruch Wayne is the Bat, then who is Bruce Wayne? Well it's obvious...

...IT'S JOHN CENA!!!

And that's why both [Batman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSaDPc1Cs5U) and [John Cena]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LitDGyxFh4))'s theme songs always seem familiar even if you've never heard them before!
