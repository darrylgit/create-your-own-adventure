Your flare flies into the sky, spewing out sparks and making crackling noises.

The chococopter has shifted its orientation and is facing you. 

You're saved! The chococopter has noticed you. 

Then suddenly from your right side a black pillet grazes your hair.

A barrage of hot, melty chocolate chip bullets are rainy down upon you. 

The pain is unbearable! Just as you are about to pass out, the 

chococopter moves in. The wind from the rotors blows the melty chocolate chip

bullets away saving you from certain death. The chococopter wisks you away to a 

submarine that is waiting nearby.
