Shri Swami Vivekananda says:


1. Education is not the amount of information that we put into your 

brain and runs riot there, undigested, all your life.

We must have life building, man making, character making assimilation of ideas.

If you have assimilated five ideas and made them your life and character

you have more education than any man who has got by heart a whole library..




2. Bear in mind, my children, that only cowards and those who are weak commit sin and tell lies. 

The brave are always moral. 

Try to be moral, try to be brave, try to be sympathising. 




3. Have faith that you are all, my brave lads, born to do great things! 

Let not the barks of puppies frighten you -- no, 

not even the thunderbolts of heaven -- but stand up and work!




4. Know that every time you feel weak, you not only hurt yourself but also the Cause. 

Infinite faith and strength are the only conditions of success.
