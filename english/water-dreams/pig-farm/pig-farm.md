You hit with a splat, your entire body folds in on itself and mixes with the pigs dinner,
 which you have just fallen into. Rather than feeling pain, 
 you feel more substantial and thicker as you disperse and become part of the slop and it becomes part of you.

Before long you hear a snort, and a large snout invades the traquil spaces of discarded food 
that make up the pigs meal. You feel yourself being sucked into his mouth, pulled down into his stomach...
and suddenly you have eyes, and feet and sharp tusks at the end of your face.
