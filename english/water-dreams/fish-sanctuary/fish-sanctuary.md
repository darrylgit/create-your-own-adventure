Ploop! What a rush! hey guys! you scream out too all the other waterdrops in the sacturary, 
as you squeeze between an endless quantity of little beings that are just like you. 

One waterdrop says, "Lookout! A fish is coming!"

You race to get out of the way before the fish gets to you.

Some waterdrops didn't get out fast enough and were taken by the fish.

Some waterdrops around you beging to cry because their friend was taken by the fish.
