Just then, a crazed ostrich smacks into you at full-speed.  Your phone flies out of your hands and you hit the pavement.  

You wake up in the hospital tied down to your bed. IV's trickle into your veins. You shout, but you're all alone.  You see your phone at your side, but it's just out of reach.  What do you do?
