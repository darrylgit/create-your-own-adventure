Congratulations, you are now helping people to decide their destiny! You are a brave person!

What sould they do?

Stay on a tedious-corporate-kindofstable-job for life until it [ends?](theend.md)

Forget about career and jump into startup world like there's no [tomorrow?](notomorrow.md)

Invite you for a freshly ground [coffee](coffee.md) and discuss about life, anything else and the number 42?
