You create a pull request on GitHub and hope that someone can quickly review your changes and agree to merge your branch into the upstream master branch. You cross your fingers that it works... and quick. Your bladder can only contain so much pee.

Seconds later, a wormhole appears!!

You step into it and hope for the best. You close your eyes and within a split second, you open your eyes to see that you are back in your room.

You immediately run into your bathroom and had the greatest pee session ever. Everything was alright in the world.




Thank goodness for GitHub!
