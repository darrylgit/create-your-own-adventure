While walking home you stumbled upon a field of strawberries. Not any ordinary strawberries, talking ones. They are talking to each other and when they see you they hush each other up. You gingerly say "Hi!"
All of them answer in a chorus, "Hi!". They seem friendly afterall!

You [start a conversation](hello/hello.md)
You [keep walking](../walk/walk.md)
You [turn back and run towards the tower](../start-running/start-running.md)
