You decide to escape the city for a 
weekend and head out to the wilderness.

With your bag all packed with camping
gear, you make your way toward the mountains.

The hike to a campsite was relatively 
easy so you settle down in a sleeping bag 
next to the campfire, and drift off to sleep. 

You awake to find you're being dragged across
the forest floor. But by who or what?

Perhaps a [bear](english/bear/bear.md) got a hold of you.

In a moment of panic, you:

[sing](english/sing/sing.md)

convince yourself you're [dreaming](english/dream/dream.md)

[meditate](english/meditate/meditate.md)

make a [haiku](english/write-a-hiku/hiku.md) to stay calm

[scream](english/scream/scream.md)
