Going for a run allows for further self reflection and ensures body and mind are at one.  
You pass a storefront window, and reflect upon the handsome man or woman reflected back.  Their powerful 
stride drives them past the leaders in the Olympic marathon.  You turn your gaze forward, enter 
the stadium to cheers and chants.  You!  You!  You!  Are one!
