Going for a run allows for further self reflection and ensures body and mind are at one.  You pass a storefront window, and reflect upon the handsome man reflected back.  His powerful stride drives him past the leaders in the Olympic marathon.  You turn your gaze forward, enter the stadium to cheers and chants.  You!  You!  You!  Are one!
