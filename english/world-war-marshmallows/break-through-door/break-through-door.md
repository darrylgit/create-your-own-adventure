You get a run up and charge at the door, it smashes open you're outside, you pause
and look right and one of them sees you, you scream and turn left and scream some more
while you sprint, you see an abandoned Winnebago RV you get in and drive looking in your 
rear-view mirror at the carnage behind you, but you're safe, for now.
