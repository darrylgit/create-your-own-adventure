Christy wakes up to a creepy noise of footsteps circling around her bed and
She shuts her eyes hard and holds the quilt tight. The volume of footsteps descends and
Christy opens her eyes and slides the quilt off her face. She looks around and finds no one
around. She's drenched in sweat and breathing heavy.
