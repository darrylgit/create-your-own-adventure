There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was honest, but still he could not earn enough to live upon. At last all he had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of shoes.

He cuts out the pieces of leather before going to bed, so that he can sew them into a pair of shoes. Elves come in the night and make the pair of shoes which he sells for more than his asking price the next day. 

Now he has just enough money to buy leather for two pair of shoes. He cuts the leather for two pairs and retires for the night. The elves come again and make two pairs of shoes. He gives away one pair to a needy person and sells the other pair to a referral from the first customer.

He buys leather for three and stays up to find the elves making the shoes. The shoemaker and wife make clothes for the elves the next day, but the elves are freed when given clothers, so they leave, and the shoemaker and his wife never see them again.
