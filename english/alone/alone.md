Alone

Chapter 1:

Kristy wakes up to the strange sounds from the walls of her dorm.

She gets off the bed and carefully look around for anything suspicious.

She senses a movement along the wall on the other side of the dorm room.

She sneaks next to the wall and tries to hear anyone on the other side of the wall.

She hears someone gasping heavily and trembles in fear.

Kristy gets drenched in sweat and sits on the edge
of her bed gulping a bottle of water.

Kristy hears someone approaching her room. She sneaks 
beneath the bed and shuts her mouth to mute her 
anxiety.

A stranger in jeans and hoodie, covering larger portion of his
face with his hood walks into the room and looks around.
