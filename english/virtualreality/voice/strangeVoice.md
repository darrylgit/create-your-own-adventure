“You might have noticed that removing your Rift 
does not return you to reality.  This is working 
as intended.”

As you inspect your head with your hands, 
you quickly realize that the hands you are seeing 
do not match up with the hands you can actually feel.

Your hands feel like normal hands,
but your left hand looks like a trout,
and your right hand looks like a hotdog.
