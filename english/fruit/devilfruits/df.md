A Devil Fruit (悪魔の実 Akuma no Mi) is a type of fruit that, which when eaten, confers a power on the consumer. There are three categories of Devil Fruits; Zoan (動物系ゾオン Zoon) fruits allow the user to fully and partially transform into a specific animal; as well as real-life animals. Some Zoan fruits allow the user to transform into mythical creatures. Logia (自然系ロギア Rogia) fruits give control over and allow the user "to change their living body structure into the powers of nature". Paramecia (超人系パラミシア Paramishia) is a category for fruits that give the user superhuman abilities. They are said to be incarnations of the sea devil himself, and as a result, Devil Fruit users cannot swim in sea water, as "they are hated by the sea".

There is never more than one devil fruit available in the world. If a user of a certain devil fruit dies, than that particular devil fruit will grow some place else in the world (usually in a location that fits its personality). Although logia devil fruits are rare, mystical zoan fruits such as the pheonix fruit is far more rarer (and in most cases powerful).
