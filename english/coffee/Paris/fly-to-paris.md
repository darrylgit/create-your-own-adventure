You get off the AirFrance flight into Charles De Gaulle Airport. Everyone is speaking French around you.

You see a young woman, about 23-24 years old, standing in the corner. You decide to ask her for help.

"Excusez-moi, mademoiselle, Je suis un américain et Je suis perdu. Est-ce que vous pouvez m'aide?"

"Mais, bien sur."

"Merçi!" you exclaim.  You tell her everything you know so far and she suggests you follow her.

She walks towards a local train into the city.  Do you?
