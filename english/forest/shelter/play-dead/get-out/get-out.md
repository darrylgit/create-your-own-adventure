After leaving the improvised tent, you realize that it's been raining for a while now. The footprints of the bear are clearly visible in the wet terrain. 
You make a few steps further, when suddently a lightining strikes your little shelter!
Shreds of wood and plants are blasted away and your parachute blazes in flames. You would have surely died if you had stayed in there.
Still dazzled and half deafned by the lighting, you see a figure dancing wildly under the storm rains. You think it could be a shawman.
When the figure notices you, it stops dancing and starts walking away. It beckons you to follow.

[Follow the shawman.](../../../fire/woods/follow/follow.md)
