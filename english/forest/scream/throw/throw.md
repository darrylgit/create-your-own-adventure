You hurl anything in your grasp towards the tiger's head. Twigs, your shoes, moss. If only he left you alone!

This seems to piss off the tiger, and he slowly comes closer.

You cower in fear, and furiously try to crawl backwards.

The tiger lunges at you, mouth open, paws ready to strike. You close your eyes and brace for the worst. Suddenly, you feel the ground pounding, swiftly followed by a loud screeching scream, as if from a giant bird. The next thing you feel is a thud, followed by a deafening roar from the tiger. You open your eyes and see a velociraptor fighting with the tiger. It looks like the hunter has become the prey.

In a reflex, you gather all your strength and limp away. You can hear a nearby river up ahead. You fear that the raptor might follow you when it's done with the tiger, or there might be more raptors around. You remembered that they hunt in packs.

Thinking that they won't like water very much, you jump into the river and wait for the screams of the fight to subside.

After a little while, the screams fade out in the forest.

Suddenly, you realize that it's not the screams that are fading, but you're moving away. You're rapidly being taken downstream the river!

With your waning strength, you can't seem to reach the shoreline. In the distance, you can hear a rumbling sound that's increasing in strength.

It's a waterfall! With all your might, you give it one last shot and swim towards the trees. You desperately look for anything to grab on to. But it's no use. You are exhausted, and the rapids take you swiftly towards your demise.

You plunge down a huge waterfall, and land in a small lake. Dazed by the impact, you manage gasp for air and just before you go under again. You see something underwater. A shadow. Gasp! Another breath of air, mixed with salty water. Then it grabs you.

You realize, that you're the bonecrushing jaws of an alligator. As it starts its death-roll, you realize that it's over. If only you hadn't screamed.
