Your hungry and tired, pizza is the only thing that will cheer you up. You
thought long and hard about fried chicken, or perhaps all you can eat mongolian
stir fry but in the end the only thing that truly matters to a programmer is hot delivery pizza. When it's done you'll hang it from your window in a pillowcase
to keep it cold and hidden from the horrible people that are after you.

You truly don't know what to order. Pineapple however makes everything better.
Suddenly a [menu](https://www.pizzahut.com.au/) appears! Another option also
appears a [menu](http://fongspizza.com/) Fong's appears.

Fong's serves delicious Asian Pizza and also offers exceptional [Tiki Drinks](http://liquor.com/slideshows/10-tiki-cocktails-to-kick-off-summer/).
