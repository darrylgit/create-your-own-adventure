Letting out a light sigh, you once grip your makeshift wand firmly and concentrate.
Gathering your focus, you point your rope and fork wand to the door and firmly encant "Alohomora!"

		The door begins to acquire a dim yellow-green glow emanating from the lock mechanism.
		Rattling sounds out from the door's keyhole as the door begins to shudder, wood
		splintering and shuddering as a resounding grinding of metal and wood fill the air.

							The door jars opens with a creak 
							as the locking mechanism breaks.

[The door is open! Is there something else I forgot?](../../marshmallow.md)
