The twinkle bursts into flashes of memory that assemble your senses into a perception
of where you are. Tendrils of deja-vu tug at your mind from movies and television and novels
reeling your conscienceness to the disturbing truth. This looks like the padded cell 
from Clockwork Orange or any of a dozen asylum scenes on TV. 

Another tug, this time on your arm, turns into a sharp pain of an needle that snakes back ot
an IV bag. 

Footsteps grow louder, then faster. The room starts to fade. Voices. Darkness.
