You have entered into the world of one of Her Majesty's secret agent. Codename Agent 008; his name is Bond, Milton Bond and he's the pencil pushing assistant of his more well-known cousin, [James](http://www.007.com/characters/the-bonds/). While James is out stopping evil-doers, rescusing damsels in distress, and having the occasional martini, Milton is responsible for making sure all of James' paperwork is in order.

Need the requisite form for a new [Aston-Martin](http://www.astonmartin.com/) for that high speed car chase? Ask Milton.

Special ordering a bespoke tuxedo for a fancy dinner and with a side of [fisticuffs](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fisticuffs)? Milton's your man.

Need someone to send in your end of mission expense report, complete with [TPS cover letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Office_space_poster.jpg#/media/File:Office_space_poster.jpg)? Milton's already one step ahead of you.
